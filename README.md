# Jenny's Blog

This website is built with Nuxt--an application framework based on VueJS, so basically I just wrote a few Vue files and components and this blog is all set.

For blog posts I used old markdown files from my old Jekyll blog, but I'm not using them as blog sources directly, but rather created an API to read the markdown files and return JSONs. So it's like using an API based CMS like Contentful or Storyblok but you don't have to store your data in their server.

Creating and optimizing my own website is fun, I will keep going and try to do better.
